Day 10: July 4, 2017 

Today's Progress: Fixed formatting of website. Had to adjust the layout of the skills and projects and create more rows for the container class.
Thoughts: Didn't get much done for the website, just fixed formatting which took longer than expected.Still not sure what to do with the background for the information section. Maybe try https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp ( model boxes for project), so website isn't clustered with projects.

Today's Progress: Worked on the website late on the 8th and also worked more on it on the 9th. Was able to create two rows, one for completed and another for future/in process.
