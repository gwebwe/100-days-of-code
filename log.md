# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: June 21, 2017 

Today's Progress: Basic layout of personal webiste, includes navigation, About Me and Project divs, and contact info.

Thoughts: Decent layout, should start filling divs with information in the next days. Make more eye popping too. Have a little trouble with <a> tags, but got it to work.
